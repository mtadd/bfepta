<h5>Become a PTA Member</h5>

<p>Brassfield Parents and Teachers,</p>

<p>Our Memberhub PTA online dues processing system is open for business, so anyone can join the PTA on line in your pjs! Please <a href="https://brassfield.memberhub.com/dues" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://brassfield.memberhub.com/dues')">join us on MemberHub</a> where a slight fee is charged (total with fee, $10.86).  You may also send in your 
<a href="{{ "/files/bres-pta-membership-form.pdf" | relative_url }}" onclick="trackDownloadLink('{{ "/files/bres-pta-membership-form.pdf" | relative_url }}')">
  membership form&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
 to the PTA mailbox in the lobby.</p>

<p>We are having a membership drive and will celebrate 400 memberships with all the kids at a recess Popcorn Party, so please encourage spouses and family members to join!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
At this point, only one membership can be processed at a time and each person must have either a unique phone number or email associated with their membership. So, if spouses have typically used one set of contact information, you must use a unique email for your membership and unique phone for your spouse and not use the same information in both membership forms.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Thank you so much for your support, we look forward to serving the kids this year, and hope you will join our team!</p>

<p>Tania Talbot<br>
BRES PTA President, 2017-18
