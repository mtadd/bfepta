    <h5>Why advocate?</h5>

    <p>Our students deserve the best public schools and teachers! We want great families and teaches to stay in NC public schools. The difference between the <a {% outbound https://www.dropbox.com/s/nz2bpoua45ehvcs/PSFNC%202017%20Legislative%20Update.pdf?dl=0 %}>2007-2008 and the 2016-2017 legislative overview</a> is hard to digest.   </p>

    <p> Our state legislature needs to fully fund the class size initiative to include money for extra teachers and specialists. <a {% outbound http://www.icontact-archive.com/VXBuOPIIMPnvxdJrOZ4nG9_sqe647Rdc?w=2 %}>Understand the class size chaos</a>.  Remember that this is a legislative mandate, not a WCPSS mandate.  </p>

    <p> Our veteran principals and teachers are a vital part to our educational system!    </p>

    <h5>What is the class size mandate?</h5>
    <p>Legislation sets next year's (2018-19) class sizes at an absolute maximum of: 
    <table class="table table-bordered">
      <tr><th>Kindergarten</th><th>1st Grade</th><th>2nd Grade</th><th>3rd Grade</th></tr>
      <tr><td>18</td><td>16</td><td>17</td><td>17</td></tr>
    </table>
    </p>

    <h5>What about budget cuts?</h5>

    <p>Public school teachers don’t have adequate funding for basic classroom needs.</p>

    <p>The new salary schedules for veteran teachers / administrators are meaning and embarrassing.   </p>

    <h5>Who is impacted? </h5>

    <p>Anyone with a child in a NC public school</p>

    <p>The legislature didn't properly fund the mandate to cut class size in the lower grades so that much-needed physical education, arts, music, and language instruction wouldn’t be eliminated.  </p>

    <p>Space for smaller classes was not accounted for, so some classes may be split or forced to meet in makeshift locations.  </p>

    <p>Teacher salaries come from one pot / allocation / fund.  If we need more teachers in K-3 classroom, we will have to increase class sizes in all grades above that (4th – 12th) to pull teachers to the lower grades. </p>
