We hope you can join us on Tuesday, 12/5, for a general PTA Meeting from 4:30-5:30 in the learning commons [Childcare available with signup](http://www.signupgenius.com/go/5080b4ea9af2eabf58-school).

Our meeting will include Treasurer report, Book Fair status, Staff Cookie Boxe update, board member updates, and spirit night news. Please join us to see the inner workings of our PTA and how we work to serve the kids at Brassfield. All parents and teachers are welcome to attend.  If you have any questions or concerns, or would like to add an item to the agenda (please give a few days notice), please contact [Tania Talbot](mailto:school@gopack.org).
