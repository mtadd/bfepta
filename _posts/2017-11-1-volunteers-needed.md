The Brassfield PTA needs parent volunteers to assist with maintaining the media center's math and science kits. Each kit engages children in a different math or science topic through at-home experiments, activities, books, and/or games.  Students may check the kits out weekly during their media center time. The PTA funds all of the kits' supplies, which are located in the PTA room.

Any amount of volunteer help is appreciated, and can be done at any time during school hours. Most kits take just a few minutes each to clean and restock. If you'd like to help out please contact Julie at [julschiavone@gmail.com](mailto:julschiavone@gmail.com) or Tara at [tarawilk@live.com](mailto:tarawilk@live.com).
