This is Jacqui Sult's last year with a student at Brassfield, and therefore, Pawsitive Paws will need a new coordinator. Jacqui has coordinated the program 9 out of 10 years at Brassfield. She has made it a well oiled machine and easy for someone to step in to the position.   Would you or someone you know like to learn more?
