Brassfield Road Elementary will  be one of Wake County's "Wake Up & Read" Book Drive Location Sites.  

Look for donation boxes in the school lobby beginning Jan. 20th.

**Over the next month or so, start making a stack of  gently used children's books that you might be willing to donate (beginning on 1/20/18) to children in Wake County who might not otherwise have books of their own to read at home.**

[See web link & donation guidelines for more information.](http://wakeupandread.org/donate/donate-your-books/)

#### Book donation guidelines:

* Books must be new or gently used and appropriate for children birth â€“ 12.
* For gently used donations, book covers, pages, and spines should be intact and without rips, tears, or added pencil/crayon markings (names of original owners/dedications are acceptable).
* Gently used books should not be damaged by mold, water, or fire, and should not show signs of discoloration or age.
* We cannot accept coloring books, activity books or magazines.
* If you have questions or you're interested in volunteering at Brassfield to help count the books donated each week, then please e-mail:  Amy Buchan @ abuchan@wcpss.net  (WUAR Book Drive Site Contact)
