Brassfield Road Elementary will once again be one of Wake County's "Wake Up & Read" Book Drive Location Sites. We will be collecting new and gently used books from **January 20 – March 3, 2018. Book donation guidelines**:

* Books must be new or gently used and appropriate for children birth – age 12.
* Gently used books:  book covers, pages, and spines should be intact and without rips, tears, or added markings (names of original owners/dedications are acceptable). They should not be damaged by mold, water, or fire, and should not show signs of discoloration or age.
* We cannot accept coloring books, activity books or magazines.
