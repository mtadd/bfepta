Super Kids Day – Friday, April 6th – Tracks 2 and 3
We are seeking parent volunteers (must be wake county approved) to help make our annual Super Kids Day (Field Day) a success by running stations and cheering our students on. Our students love Super Kids Day and will enjoy seeing a parent attend this event. No prior experience is needed. First time volunteers are encouraged and welcome!

We will have two sessions on April 6th for tracks 2 and 3 ~ one for grades K-2 from 9:15-11:30 am and one for grades 3-5 from 12:15-2:30 pm.  This event will be held behind the school at the playground and field. Use this sign-up genius to secure your session and station.   

Tracks 1 and 4 – Save the date for your Super Kids Day on Friday, May 11th. Volunteer sign-up will be available in April.
