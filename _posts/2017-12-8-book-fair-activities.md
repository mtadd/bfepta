Holidays are just around the corner. Are the lists generated? A fabulous gift idea for the children in your life is BOOKS!

* Brassfield Winter Book Fair is coming soon and will run Nov. 27th - Dec. 8th, open weekdays 8:45am â€“ 4:00pm.

There are many opportunities to shop:

* Drop off in the morning and pick up in the afternoon
* Come meet your child for lunch and shop the fair together!
* Shop during one of our Book Fair activies-- See below!

The book fair needs volunteers throughout the next two weeks. We especially [need volunteers](http://www.signupgenius.com/go/5080b4ea9af2eabf58-book) to support your child's class and others as the kid's make their book fair selections (help is most needed for the younger kids from 12:45-3:30pm)
