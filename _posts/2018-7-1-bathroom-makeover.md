Thank you to our sponsors Spectrum Paint's New Baileywick Rd location for paint donations and Pinot's Palette, Brier Creek, for donating fabulous paintings and possibly prizes!

Join a Team to improve our staff bathroom's appearance and morale!  We could really use some help in the cleaning and prepping for painting departments!  Design Teams will focus on improving the aesthetics of the bathrooms. 

Our staff bathrooms look much the same as they did 30 years ago only much more worn and tired.  Let's help improve them and show the teachers we care about their work environment.
