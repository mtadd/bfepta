Your feedback is requested on PTA Budget Spending:
<br>
__How should the PTA use it’s funds to support the kids and school?__

Your ideas and involvement are appreciated! Please fill out this google form to make suggestions for PTA fund allocations for excess funding above our current budget and through cost savings achieved by our frugal and generous volunteers! This is your opportunity to advocate for our [children’s and school’s needs](https://goo.gl/forms/Sxhb9HgOcaRVuyCP2)

Please make your recommendations by 3/23, Friday! Once our budget is amended, there will be no additional opportunity to allocate funds for this school year.
