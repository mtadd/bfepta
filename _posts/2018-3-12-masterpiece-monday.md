Greetings from the Art Room, If you are interested in helping display student artwork in the frames throughout the main building at Brassfield, we would love to have your help for our semi-annual Masterpiece Monday framing event the morning of March 12th! Please feel free to join us during student arrival. 

This particular Monday is a workday for me, so there will be no students working in the art room on this day. At our first Masterpiece Monday event we were mostly finished by 11 o'clock. The slots are flexible, so feel free to drop in whenever you are available. As always, there will be coffee and breakfast items to munch on while we work. Thank you so much for any help you are able to provide in showcasing the extraordinary talent of our Brassfield artists!
