<p>The North Carolina Legislature passed an unfunded K-3 class size mandate
last spring which will take full effect in 2018-2019.  Join us on October
16 to hear about the mandate, how it will affect Wake County Public
Schools, and the possible solutions offered by the school district to deal
with the new requirements.  We will also discuss what PTA units, leaders,
members and parents can do to advocate for our students and teachers.</p>

<p>Come join us to be part of an open discussion of strategy ideas to affect
change! Questions? <a href="mailto:school@gopack.org">Tania</a>
