The Brassfield Math & Science Extravaganza committee seeks 2 volunteers to join John Jones and Jennifer Oldson. This year’s obligation will be light; simply shadow the current co-directors. Observe what currently is done, how it is done, and when it is done. In the hope that you stay with us the following year (2019) then, with John and Jennifer’s support, assume responsibility for some of the tasks as you become more comfortable. If, however, you do not want a mentoring period but are ready to become more actively engaged right now then reach out to John Jones and he will get you started (he promises). 

**Two types of persons are sought.**
1. A person comfortable communicating with guest exhibitors; who would reach out to current and new/fresh guest exhibitors to arrange and track their confirmation to participate and to acquire their guest approval forms.

2. A person comfortable with Microsoft Excel and Word; who would serve as registrar tracking participating students, printing certificates, and printing event night programs.

Ideally you are a parent/guardian with a student in the K-2 grades.  This is a once per year commitment that supports not only the students and their interest in science but engages parents and guardians and guest exhibitors lifting the evening above a mere show and tell to become a Brassfield community extravaganza! To become a part of this great service to others please contact John Jones or Jennifer Oldson this week. 

Kindest regards, 

John Jones - [jt.jones@earthlink.net](jt.jones@earthlink.net) - (919) 605-7976
