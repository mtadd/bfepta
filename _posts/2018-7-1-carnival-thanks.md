Thank you to all who came out for the end of year Carnival.  
<p>We want to especially thank the carnival planning team, our PTA members, volunteers, donors, and vendors. This event was a collective effort and it would not have been possible without everyoneâ€™s efforts and contributions. If you are excited about participating in this event again, please be sure to join the PTA for the 2018-2019 school year! Our PTA funds new and exciting student-focused events. Mark your calendars tentatively for Friday, May 31, 2019 for our next end of year carnival.</p>
