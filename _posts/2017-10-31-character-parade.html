<p>Calling all characters! Book characters, that is! In a celebration of reading, Brassfield students will parade the school on October 31st carrying their favorite book, dressed as their favorite character. Classrooms across the school will tie the experience to grade level curriculum. From Winnie the Pooh to Harry Potter we can't wait to bring books to life! Be on the lookout for specific information on how to participate from your teacher. Track 3 families are encouraged to come back to school and participate, but be sure to check into the front office with Kimberly when you arrive.</p>
