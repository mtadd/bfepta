<p>The book fair committee is looking for volunteers to help with our Winter Book Fair!  We will have an informational meeting at 2:00pm on Monday, October 16th in the Learning Commons to go over areas where help is needed and the estimated time commitment for each job.  Some items can even be done from home, and no amount of help is too small! This year, all proceeds from the fair will go towards improving our library collection, so please stop in and see how you can help make this fundraiser a success! Questions? <a href="mailto:Ericatadd@Hotmail.com">Email Erica Tadd</a></p>
<p class="signed">-Thanks,The Book Fair Committee</p>
