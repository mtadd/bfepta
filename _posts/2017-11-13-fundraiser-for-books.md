Next week, 11/13-11/17, we will be doing a change drive to help raise money for
kids in local communities who need books!  Any additional money raised may be
used to buy books for our school library or help teachers refresh their
classroom libraries.  

Bring in those pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters to fill the jug in the
lobby. Who will be able to fill the jug faster, boys or girls? As an added
bonus, Scholastic will purchase a book for each $1 raised and provide up to
1 million books to charities such as the Kids In Need Foundation, Reader to
Reader, Inc., and the National Center for Families Learning.
