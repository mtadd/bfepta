Brassfield be participating in the Crayola ColorCycle marker recycling program. Collection bins will be  placed throughout the school to recycle dried-up markers.  This is a great way to keep those out of the landfills! You can also bring any markers from home to drop in the bins.  They do not have to be Crayola markers. Questions, Contact [Sarah O'Connor](mailto:sarahoconnor@me.com).
