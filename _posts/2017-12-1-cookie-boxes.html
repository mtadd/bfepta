It's hard to believe the holidays are upon us. That means it's almost time to get out the flour and sugar and send some good cheer to all of the teachers and staff at Brassfield who do so much for our children every day. Each year, the PTA Staff Appreciation & Hospitality Committee, together with the support of our wonderful parent volunteers, assembles a box of homemade cookies for each teacher and staff member at the school. We hear countless compliments and words of thanks for doing this and have been told repeatedly it's one of the favorite days of the school year. </p>

UPDATE! We are currently short 125 dozen cookies.  The staff loves the cookie boxes provided by Brassfield families at the holidays.  No time to bake?  Store bought are perfect for all, but especially for our staff with GF and Dairy Free allergies.</p>
