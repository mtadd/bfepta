Brassfieldâ€™s first Spring Carnival will be held on **Friday, June 1st**  in the Lower Field @ 5-8 PM. Bring the family out to enjoy inflatables, games, food, prizes, face painting, a cake walk, a dunk booth and more.   

**Donations:**  Thank you families for your generous donations! [You too can sign-up to provide carnival donations](http://www.signupgenius.com/go/5080b4ea9af2eabf58-spring)  (like small prizes, candy, cakes, soda, water, etc). Donations can be dropped off in the school lobby through Wednesday, May 16th.  

[Volunteers can sign-up now to run a game.](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/5080b4ea9af2eabf58-spring2) We are offering 2 shifts during the event to allow everyone time to work and enjoy the carnival with their family. Without our volunteers, we will not be able to run all the game stations we have put together, so please sign-up and encourage other wake county approved volunteers to secure their spot early. Grab a friend and work a station together! It is NOT too late to seek approval. Find out more at the game volunteer link. 

**Games:** Most games will take 1-2 tickets, with a few free games. To help you plan, one child will be able to play each game once with 20 tickets. Save money and order now!

**Pre-Sale Tickets** are encouraged.  You save money and it will help us gauge attendance, helping us to have enough food and prizes. Pre-Sale tickets are available at a discount ($4 for 10 tickets, $6 for 15 tickets, $10 for 25 tickets or $20 for 50 tickets), by returning your pre-order form with payment (in a sealed envelope) or during afternoon carpool on 5/15 or 5/30, or Movie Night on 5/18.  

The Spring Carnival is a PTA sponsored event.
