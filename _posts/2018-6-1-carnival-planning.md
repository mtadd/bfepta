Co Chair(s) and Sponsorship Needed! Super Kids Day!<br>
Brassfield Carnival Planning needs Volunteers!<br>
<br>
Looking for anyone interested in Co-chairing our Super Kids Day.  This year’s dates are, Tracks 2 & 3- April 6th, Tracks 1 & 4-May 11th.  Best day of the year for the students as they participate in Field Games outside!  

Also looking for a company or companies to sponsor this year’s blow up obstacle course. This is always a big hit at SKD and a great help if you are willing to donate towards it.
