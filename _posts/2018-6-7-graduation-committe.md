The 5th Grade Graduation Committee is looking for a **wireless photo printer to borrow for the days of the event (June 7for Track 1 and June 29 for Tracks 2,3,and 4)**.  We'd like to do a photo booth for the kids and then be able to print out the photos for them to take home.  (We will provide the photo paper.)  If you have a printer that you are willing to lend us for the event, please [email Melinda Hemphill](mailto:jaymelinda@yahoo.com).  Thank you!!
