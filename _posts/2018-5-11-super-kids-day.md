One down, One to go! We are seeking parent volunteers (must be wake county approved) to help make our annual **Super Kids Day (Field Day)** a success by running stations and cheering our students on. Students love Super Kids Day and will enjoy seeing a parent attend this event. No prior experience is needed. In fact, first time volunteers are encouraged and welcome!

We will have two sessions on **May 11th for tracks 1 and 4** , one for **grades K-2 from 9:15-11:30 am** and one for **grades 3-5 from 12:15-2:30 pm**.  This event will be held behind the school at the playground and field. [Use this sign-up genius](http://www.signupgenius.com/go/5080B4EA9AF2EABF58-super1) to secure your session and station.
