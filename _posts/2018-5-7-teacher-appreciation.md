Join us to celebrate all our teachers.  As in yearâ€™s past each class will have a teacher pairing, so please honor both teachers.  [Sign up to help](http://www.signupgenius.com/go/5080b4ea9af2eabf58-brassfield2) with school wide TA requests and get the details.   

* Monday - Dunkin Donuts has donated Donuts, Bagels, Iced Coffee, & Coffees to celebrate our Super Hero Teachers!

* Tuesday - Send S's-Day:  Snack, Sweet, Soda, or School Supply!  Please check with your Room Mom about what your teacher prefers most!

* Wednesday - Fresh Fruit & Free Recess!  Sign up to send in fruit or cover a grade level (or two) recess for teachers giving them a much needed break!  

* Thursday - Gift Card Day & PTA is providing lunch from Sassool.  T2 Students should send their cards or coloring page (below) in on Thursday.
