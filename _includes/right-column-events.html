<h5><a href="{{ "/pages/class-size-chaos.html" | relative_url }}">What is the class size mandate?</a></h5>
<p>The maximum individual K-3 class sizes will drop from 24 students to:  K: 18, 1st: 16, and 2nd: 17 students.  For a year round school like ours, imagine pulling 2 students from the K class as they graduate to 1st and then adding one back when they rise to 2nd.  Children need some stability and consistency.  Pulling one or two kids from a track and switching them year to year and possibly from track to track will have broad reaching implications for families with older siblings.</p>

<p>We have many volunteer opportunities throughout the school year, and we welcome all help even if it's 1 hour, 1 day, once a month or once a year!  Every little bit helps further our goal to improve the kids experiences at school and their educational opportunities.  Next week, we'll be sending out a link and information regarding our PTA positions that are still open.  Please click the heading to access volunteer opportunities available throughout the coming year, and we appreciate your service!</p>
