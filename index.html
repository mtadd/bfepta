<p class="greeting">Dear Brassfield Families:</p>

<p class="indent">Welcome to our new and returning families!  With your support, we can continue to grow our BRES community with vibrant parent involvement.  “A strong PTA represents parent involvement and parent involvement represents student success.”</p>

<p class="indent">Please join the PTA and become an active supporter of our programs to enhance and enrich the kid’s experiences like PTA’s four Cultural Arts Performances, Math and Science Extravaganza, library book purchases, and more than 6 clubs or groups outside school hours.  Our fundraisers fund the opportunities to enrich the children’s lives and educational experiences and improve the school.   This year (volunteer permitting), we are hoping to add a Spring Carnival and a few more clubs.  We are humbled and inspired by our volunteers who give so generously.</p>

<p class="indent">We look forward to getting to know your family!  Please join us at open house on Tuesday, 7/18 and 8/8 (Track 4), join the PTA, learn about volunteer opportunities, talk to our committee chairs, learn about the events the PTA has planned, and much more.  Please mark your calendars and join us for our first general PTA meeting at 3pm on Tuesday, 8/1, to approve our budget.   Please check our Memberhub school calendar for future meetings and events.  All PTA members are welcome to attend any meeting including board meetings.</p>

<p class="indent">On behalf of the PTA Executive Board, our chairs, and all the volunteers, we wish everyone a very productive year ahead and look forward to your continued support.  Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:school@gopack.org">school@gopack.org</a>. Please know that questions, suggestions, and especially solutions are always welcome!</p>
