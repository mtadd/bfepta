<p class="greeting">Dear Brassfield Families:</p>

<p class="indent">Thank you for all your support this year! With involved parents and staff, we can continue to grow our BRES community. This year we are continuing great traditions of our past PTAs and striving to add a few new programs for the children including Morning Movement and a Spring Carnival.</p>

<p class="indent">We are currently under budget with our donations. Please support our programs for the kids through no cost options by relinking your Harris Teeter & Lowes Foods grocery cards and shopping Amazon Smile(see links). Please attend our Spirit Events at local businesses who donate a portion of their proceeds. If you missed your opportunity to donate earlier or simply want to help ensure we can fund our Spring Carnival and more, please send a check into the PTA Mailbox labeled “Donation” or please <a href="https://brassfield.memberhub.com/dues">join and/or give</a>.

<p class="indent">Please join the PTA and become an active supporter of our programs to enhance and enrich the kid’s experiences like PTA’s four Cultural Arts Performances, Math and Science Extravaganza, library book purchases, and many more clubs and programs. Our fund-raisers fund opportunities to enrich the children’s lives, educational experiences, and improve the school. We are humbled and inspired by our volunteers who give so generously.</p>

<p class="indent">We’ve started a general volunteer sign up to help parents plan to attend and volunteer at school wide events this year. Registered volunteers can <a href="http://www.signupgenius.com/go/5080b4ea9af2eabf58-school">sign up for various events</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">If you are interested in becoming more involved, <a href="http://www.signupgenius.com/go/5080b4ea9af2eabf58-brassfield">join PTA Committees</a>.

<p class="indent">On behalf of the PTA Executive Board, our chairs, and all the volunteers, we wish everyone a very productive year ahead and look forward to your continued support. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:contactus@brassfieldpta.org">contactus@brassfieldpta.org</a>. Please know that questions, suggestions, and especially solutions are always welcome!</p>
